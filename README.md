## Summary

After I enrolled in software development mentorship program back in March 2021, I was able to actually start building my first real world project (Digital Clock). Having a structrized roadmap along with mentors guidance, I quickly started to realize the importance of the baby steps to write each line of code and following along with what the logic is intented to do.

In this project, I learned how several topics are being used in Javascript (i.e template literals, declaring a funcation, calling a function, storing date into a variable, const vs let vs var, conditional statement, and method vs property).
